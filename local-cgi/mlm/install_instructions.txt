  ####################################
  # Notes: 

           All Files starting with an underscore are avaiable
           for customization to match your sites look.

           Be sure before editing templates to make a backup copy
           of all files. Backing up the entire .zip you received
           would be ideal.

           Remember when uploading data files & .cgi files, upload
           in ASCII mode. Uploading a .cgi or .pl file in BINARY will
           cause it not to execute correctly. After uploading
           set its file permission to 755 (Executable).

           Make sure all .cgi or .pl files have the correct path
           to Perl 5 on your server. Check the FAQ below to find
           out where Perl 5 is on your server.

           Do not rename any files except for the  main program
           file (MLM_v*.cgi) All other files need to keep the names
           they were packaged as.


   #
  #
#
# Installation Procedures:
 #
   #######################

   * Note:  Create a directory for Mailing List Manager & set it 
            to mode mode 777 (writable) (If your server requires
            .cgi files in a cgi-bin, create a 'MLM' or directory name
             of your choice  inside your CGI-Bin). All files packaged with
            this program should be in one directory w/ the correct file
            permissions.


   Unzip the archive file you received from CGI World and copy the
   files into the directory on your web site where you want the
   Mailing List Manager  Program to run.  

   * NOTE:

      You must upload all data & CGI files in ASCII mode
      for them to run correctly. Upload all other files
      (HTML, Images, Blat.exe in Binary Mode).


   Make sure the program file (MLM_v*.cgi & edis-lib.pl)
   have execute permissions (755) and the directory you created
   for the program has write permissions (777). Set the
   'mlm_config.dat.cgi' file to writable permissions (666).
   Otherwise you will not be able to update your preferences.
   

   Run the MLM_v*.cgi file from your browser. If you receive
   HTML output from the script the CGI is executing properly.
   To enter the administration area add a '?admin' extension
   to the end of the .cgi File name. (ie: MLM_v*.cgi?admin)

   You can now start creating your Mailing Lists! Remember
   to set your admin password.

   * NOTE TO WINDOWS/BLAT USERS:

      - If you're using MLManager with Blat email for
        Windows webservers, upload the blat.exe file
        to the same directory you run the Mailing List
        Manager Program in.

        Remember to upload 'blat.exe' in Binary Format.

# Using Mailing List Manager:
 #
   ##########################

   * Customizing the Viewer Interface:
     --------------------------------

      * FILE NAME: _mlm_select_login.html

      -  This is the HTML Page where they enter their email address.
      -  Customize the HTML in this file to give it your
      -  web sites look.


      * FILE NAME: _mlm_select.html

      -  This is the HTML Page where they select lists they would
      -  like to subscribe to.
      -  Customize the HTML in this file to give it your
      -  web sites look.


      * FILE NAME: _mlm_select_saved.html

      -  This is the HTML Page that tells them the their
      -  information on lists they have subscribed to has
      -  been saved.

      * All Other files do not need to be customized as they
      * are the administration areas of the program.


   * Different Options for Subscribing:
     ---------------------------------

     1) Letting users enter their email address in a input 
        box, then be taken to a page that lists the
        mailing lists you have setup that they can then
        subscribe to.

        The HTML you would use is:

        -------------------------------------------
        <form method=post action="http://www.url_to.com/mlm.cgi">
        <input type=text name="email">
        -------------------------------------------

     2) Letting users enter their email address & be
        automatically subscribed to lists you have setup.

        The HTML you would use is:

        -------------------------------------------
        <form method=post action="http://www.url_to.com/mlm.cgi">
        <input type=text name="email">
        <input type=hidden name="list1" value="on">
        <input type=hidden name="list2" value="on">
        <input type=hidden name="select_save" value="1">

        Note:  To find out a lists "name" go into the
               administration area and look at the source
               code to figure out what list #'s are attached
               to each list.

        -------------------------------------------
 
     3) If you are looking to keep the subscribing option
        as default, you will just need to customize those
        3 HTML pages.

# Frequently Asked Questions:
 #
   ##########################

   Q) The script is producing a Internal Server Error when
      I view the .cgi script w/ my browser:

      * A) This could be because of several reasons. First, did
           you upload the .cgi script in ASCII Mode? Set the 
           CGI Script to mode 755 (chmod 755 filename.cgi) or
           not have the correct path to Perl5 as the top line?

           If the above checks out, at telnet type:

           perl -c filename.cgi - This will tell you what errors
           perl has found with the script. If you happen to get
           a syntax error, it may be because you're not using a
           recent version of perl 5. If you get a syntax OK 
           message back, check again the first set of possible
           problems.

           To find where perl5 is on your server type:
 
           whereis perl5

           To find which version of perl is at /usr/bin/perl type:

           perl -v
